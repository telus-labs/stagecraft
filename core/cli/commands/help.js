Usage: devteam <command> [args]

Commands:
  init --host <list> [--force]     Install host adapter(s) into the current
       [--adapter <name>]           project. <list> is comma-separated, e.g.
       [--profile dogfood]          "claude-code" or "claude-code,codex".
                                   Writes .devteam/config.yml and creates
                                   pipeline/gates/ workspace. --adapter sets
                                   the stage-08 deploy target (gizmos,
                                   cloud-run, docker-compose, kubernetes,
                                   terraform, custom) so you don't need to
                                   hand-edit config.yml. --profile dogfood
                                   installs four dogfooding safeguards: a
                                   supplemental .gitignore block, a pre-commit
                                   infrastructure guard, a .git/info/exclude
                                   entry for deploy.md, and a profile: dogfood
                                   config marker. See docs/guides/dogfooding.md.
  stage <name> [--feature "..."]   Render stage prompt(s) for <name>. With
        [--feature-file <path>]       --feature-file reads the feature brief
                                   from a UTF-8 text file.
        [--headless]                 With --headless, drives each workstream's
        [--timeout-ms N]             host CLI non-interactively (claude --print,
        [--patch [--from <stage>]]   codex exec) and reports exit codes +
        [--skip-completed]           gate paths. --timeout-ms caps each
        [--workstream <role>]        workstream's wall-clock (default 600000,
                                   i.e. 10 min); pass 0 to disable.
                                   --patch scopes build agents to the patch
                                   items from the named stage's gate (reads
                                   must_address_before_peer_review, falling
                                   back to blockers[]); default: red-team.
                                   --skip-completed skips dispatching any
                                   workstream whose gate file already exists.
                                   --workstream <role> dispatches only the
                                   named role; repeat for multiple. All other
                                   workstreams are left untouched (their
                                   existing gate files are preserved).
  next [--json]                    Inspect pipeline/gates/ and report what
                                   to do next: run a stage, continue a
                                   partial multi-role stage, merge, fix a
                                   FAIL, resolve an ESCALATE, or done.
  run [--feature "..."]            Bounded autonomous driver: loop next →
      [--feature-file <path>]       dispatch → merge until pipeline-complete.
                                   --feature-file reads the feature brief
      [--repair "symptom"]          from a UTF-8 text file. --feature for
      [--repair-at <file:line>]     additive work; --repair for
      [--track <t>] [--until <s>]  bug fixes (ADR-009, hotfix depth default;
      [--max-iterations N]          diagnosis stage + PATCH-MODE-scoped build
      [--budget-usd X]              + failing-first reproduction). --repair-at
      [--timeout-ms N]              skips diagnosis, seeds affected-files.
      [--retry-delay-ms N]          Auto-fixes code-defect FAILs and retries
      [--auto-rule <classes>]       transient failures. With --auto-rule,
      [--allow-stage <s>]           auto-applies Principal rulings whose
                                   [class:] is in the granted allowlist.
      [--resume] [--force] [--json] Halts for a human on escalations, the
      [--fail-on-advisory[=all]]    consequence ceiling (sign-off / deploy),
      [--auto-commit]               a budget cap, or a structural failure.
                                   --fail-on-advisory exits 3 when advisory
                                   blockers remain (=all adds PEER_REVIEW_RISK).
                                   --auto-commit commits pipeline artifacts on
                                   a clean halt (ceiling, --until, budget).
                                   Writes run.lock, run-state.json, run-log.
  commit [--all]                   Commit pipeline artifacts after a clean
         [--dry-run]                pipeline stage. Stages only gate-bearing
         [--message "..."]          files for completed stages (cursor-aware);
         [--json] [--cwd <dir>]     --all stages all completed stages regardless
                                   of cursor. --dry-run prints without committing.
                                   Used automatically by --auto-commit.
  compact [--dry-run]              Remove all devteam-managed marker sections
          [--json] [--cwd <dir>]   from pipeline/context.md. These sections
                                   (run-blockers, red-team-blockers, deploy-
                                   target, etc.) are regenerated by devteam on
                                   the next run when still needed. Use to prune
                                   context.md after a long pipeline run or
                                   before switching to bounded isolation.
                                   --dry-run shows what would be removed.
  hook <name>                      Dispatch a framework hook script by name.
                                   Names: validate, secret-scan, approval-
                                   derivation. Used by .claude/settings.local.json
                                   hooks; resolves script paths at runtime so
                                   the file is portable across machines.
  validate                         Validate the most recent gate in
                                   pipeline/gates/. Exit codes: 0 PASS/WARN,
                                   1 malformed, 2 FAIL, 3 ESCALATE. Used
                                   by host hooks (e.g. Claude Code Stop).
  verify-chain [--track <t>]       C6: verify the tamper-evident gate chain —
       [--json]                     each stage gate commits to a hash of its
                                   predecessor. Reports breaks + unstamped
                                   gates. Exit 0 intact, 1 broken (CI-usable).
  stamp-chain [--track <t>]        C6: (re)stamp the chain on all stage gates,
                                   in order. Use after a deliberate earlier-
                                   stage re-run, or to stamp interactive gates.
  merge <stage>                    Merge per-workstream gates into stage gate.
  preflight [--cwd <dir>]          Run mechanical pre-peer-review checks
       [--skip-write]               (stage-04e): committed-but-ignored files,
                                   broken test import paths, and deferred red-team
                                   item count. Writes pipeline/gates/stage-04e.json.
                                   Exits 1 on FAIL. Also runs automatically when
                                   'devteam stage peer-review' is invoked (unless
                                   stage-04e.json already exists and is PASS).
  derive-approvals [<file>]        Re-run the approval-derivation hook on
        [--cwd <dir>] [--json]      pipeline/code-review/by-*.md and rewrite the
                                   per-area stage-05.<area>.json gates. Use after
                                   hand-editing a review file outside an active
                                   Claude Code session (the hook only fires on
                                   agent saves; shell/editor saves bypass it).
                                   Without an argument, derives every by-*.md
                                   under pipeline/code-review/. Follow with
                                   'devteam merge peer-review' to rebuild the
                                   merged stage-05.json. See docs/runbooks/
                                   fix-and-retry.md § Case 5.
  restart <stage> [--cascade]      Clear a stage's gate(s) so the pipeline can
       [--keep-context]            re-run it. With --cascade, also clears every
       [--dry-run]                 stage that comes after this one in the active
                                   track. By default also strips that stage's
                                   injected blocker sections from pipeline/
                                   context.md (--keep-context to preserve them).
                                   Use after an ESCALATE or FAIL to re-run from
                                   a specific point.
  ruling [--topic "..."]           Dispatch the Principal subagent for an ad-hoc
       [--context paths]           ruling. --topic is optional: when omitted the
       [--target-gate path]        topic is auto-derived from the escalating gate's
       [--headless]                escalation_reason + decision_needed. The ruling
                                   lands in pipeline/context.md as a PRINCIPAL-RULING
                                   line; no gate is written.
                                   See docs/runbooks/escalation.md.
  fix-escalation                   Implement the Principal ruling written by
       [--headless]                devteam ruling. Dispatches an applicator agent
                                   that reads PRINCIPAL-RULING entries from
                                   pipeline/context.md and fixes gates, runs stages,
                                   and merges — so devteam next advances. No
                                   hand-editing required.
  advise [--apply <selections>]    Triage noted_for_followup[] items across all
         [--feature "..."]          completed gates. Classifies each as
         [--json] [--cwd <dir>]     QA_BLOCKER, PEER_REVIEW_RISK, QA_NOISE, or
         [--timeout-ms N]           INFO. --apply writes selections to
                                   pipeline/context.md (format: AC-11=A,AC-12=B
                                   or AC-11=A:TICKET-123). Runs automatically at
                                   pipeline-complete when items are present.
  status [--json]                  Liveness report (ADR-007 Tier 1): reads
                                   run-state.json + run-log.jsonl tail and

  summary [--json]                 One-screen pipeline state report.
  log [--follow] [--json]          Chronological event timeline: every gate
                                   and every artifact write, in mtime order,
                                   with key fields per stage. --follow tails

                                   explicitly superseded — architecture
                                   doesn't drift because the architect remembers.
  reproduce <stage-id> [--json]    Read pipeline/gates/<stage-id>.json
                                   and report what was recorded for replay
                                   (model_version, temperature, seed, prompt
                                   hash, tools hash). Re-renders the current
                                   prompt and compares hashes to surface drift.
  verify <stage-id> [--json]       Orchestrator-stamped verification. For

                                   + AC mapping), runs the configured commands
                                   and rewrites the gate fields with what was
                                   actually observed. Flips status to FAIL if
                                   the orchestrator's truth disagrees with the

Quickstart:
  1. cd into your target project (NOT the Stagecraft repo).
  2. devteam init --host claude-code         # lays down rules, roles, hooks
  3. devteam doctor                          # verify install
  4. devteam stage requirements --feature "your feature description"
       — by default, this RENDERS the prompt; you feed it to your model.
       — inside Claude Code, use /devteam stage <name> instead.
       — to drive the host CLI automatically: add --headless.
  5. After the model writes the gate JSON: devteam next  → tells you
     what to do next (advance, fix, merge, escalate, or done).

devteam never calls a model itself. Adapters under hosts/ are where the
host-specific glue lives; the orchestrator just renders prompts and
validates the gate JSON that comes back.
