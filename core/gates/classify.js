// Gate-time failure classification (ADR-003 / BACKLOG H1, Phase 0).
//
// `next()` historically collapsed every non-pass, non-escalate gate into a
// single `fix-and-retry` action — a corrupt gate file and a failing test got
// the same response. This module assigns a `failure_class` to a non-pass gate
// so callers (the human stage manager today; the autonomous driver later) can
// react correctly instead of blindly retrying.
//
// Classes are defined by the RESPONSE they require, not by their cause:
//
//   state-corruption — the gate can't be read/parsed. Re-running the stage
//                       cannot fix corruption; the file must be repaired.
//   judgment-gate    — status ESCALATE. Needs a ruling, not a retry.
//   external-blocked — status FAIL whose only computed remedy is human/
//                       external action (we HAVE a fix recipe but every step
//                       has no executable command — e.g. "obtain PM sign-off").
//   code-defect      — status FAIL with executable fix steps, OR no recipe at
//                       all. The implementing agent must change code; re-dispatch.
//
// A fifth class, `convergence-exhausted`, is NOT decided here — it depends on
// the gate's retry_number and the configured ceiling, which only next() holds.
// next() applies it before classifyGate when the retry budget is spent.
//
// Note on `code-defect` vs `external-blocked`: a FAIL with NO recipe
// (computeFixSteps returned null) is treated as code-defect, not
// external-blocked. A missing recipe means "we can't auto-generate steps,"
// which is usually an un-recipe'd code fix (e.g. security-review findings the
// agent must address in code) — not a human-only action. external-blocked is
// reserved for the case where we DO have a recipe and it is entirely
// human/external steps.
//
// This module is a pure function: no I/O, no config. It is the gate-time half
// of the failure model; the dispatch-time half (classifyDispatch — transient
// vs structural-input) lands with the driver (H2), which is the only caller
// that holds runHeadless's return.

// Default retry budget before next() escalates a still-FAIL stage instead of
// returning fix-and-retry again. Overridable via config (autonomy.max_retries).
