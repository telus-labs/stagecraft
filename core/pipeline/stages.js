// Stage definitions for the ai-dev-team pipeline.
//
// Each stage carries `roles: string[]` (1+). The orchestrator decomposes
// multi-role stages into one workstream dispatch per role; single-role
// stages produce a single dispatch (same code path).
//
// Numbering: 1=requirements, 2=design, 3=clarify, 4=build, 4a=pre-review,
// 4b=security review, 5=peer-review (per-area), 6=tests, 7=sign-off,
// 8=deploy, 9=retro.
//
// Paths are host-neutral. Host adapters rewrite `readFirst` at
// renderStagePrompt time (e.g. AGENTS.md → CLAUDE.md for Claude Code).
// `gate` is the stage-specific skeleton shown to the LLM in the stage
// prompt; base fields (stage, status, orchestrator, track, timestamp,
// blockers, warnings) are filled by the orchestrator at write time.
