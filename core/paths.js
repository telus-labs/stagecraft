// change under review, so every "what changed?" reader filters them out —
// the changed-file manifest, right-sizing's role inference, and the file list
// `assess` scores a track from.
//
// This list used to be copy-pasted into each of those three readers, and all
// three drifted the same way: they covered `.codex/` and nothing else, so an
// operator who ran `devteam init --host claude-code` and had not yet committed
// got 68 framework files reported as their diff. In `assess` that was not just
// noise — `.claude/skills/qa-test-authoring/SKILL.md` matches the security
// heuristic's `/auth/i` on the word "authoring", which promoted a trivial
// change from `loop` (4 dispatches) to `full` (20+). One shared predicate is
// what stops the three from drifting apart again.
