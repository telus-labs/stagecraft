# Contributing to Stagecraft

Concrete recipes for the four most common kinds of change.

Before starting: read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the load-bearing contracts. Edits that break them can silently corrupt downstream behavior. The tier-1 test suite catches most contract regressions, but the burden of verification is on the contributor.

## Setup

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd stagecraft
npm install
./bin/devteam help    # verify it loads
```

Run smoke tests with a temp target project:

```bash
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
./bin/devteam init --host claude-code --cwd "$TMPDIR"
./bin/devteam stages --cwd "$TMPDIR"
./bin/devteam stage requirements --cwd "$TMPDIR" --feature "Test feature"
```

## Recipe 1 — Adding a host adapter

You want to add support for a new AI tool (e.g. Gemini CLI, Cursor, Aider).

1. **Create the directory and capabilities.**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p hosts/<name>/install
   ```
   `hosts/<name>/capabilities.json` declares what the host can do. See `hosts/codex/capabilities.json` for a minimal example. Key fields:
   - `hooks`, `subagents`, `slashCommands`, `worktrees`, `headless` — booleans
   - `headlessCommand` — the shell command if `headless: true` (e.g. `"gemini --print"`)
   - `enforces` — where the host enforces each core rule (`tool-call-time` / `post-hoc-audit` / `prompt-only`)
   - Path conventions: `skillsDir`, `commandsDir`, `agentsDir`, `rolePromptsDir` — whichever apply

2. **Implement the adapter contract** in `hosts/<name>/adapter.js`. See `core/adapters/host-adapter.md` for the formal contract. Required methods: `install`, `renderStagePrompt`, `status`, `uninstall`. Optional: `invoke` (only if `headless: true`).

   For headless, reuse the shared helper:
   ```js
   const { runHeadless } = require("../../core/adapters/headless");
   function invoke(d, c) { return runHeadless(module.exports, d, c); }
   ```

3. **Install payload**, if any. Anything host-specific that needs to be copied to the target project goes under `hosts/<name>/install/`. The adapter's `install()` function copies these to the right place in the target.

4. **Mirror `installRoles`, `installRules`, `installSkills`** from an existing adapter. Each adapter is responsible for laying down the host-specific copies of the shared `roles/`, `rules/`, and `skills/` directories.

5. **Verify locally.**
   ```bash
   ./bin/devteam hosts                    # new host appears
   TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
   ./bin/devteam init --host <name> --cwd "$TMPDIR"
   find "$TMPDIR" -type f                 # expected files landed
   ```

6. **Add a tier-1 contract assertion**: your adapter must export `capabilities`, `install`, `renderStagePrompt`, `status`, `uninstall` — same shape as `tests/adapter-contract.test.js` asserts. Run `npm test` to verify.

Examples to copy from:
- `hosts/generic/` — minimal; install is a no-op.
- `hosts/codex/` — moderate; renders roles + rules + skills, no hooks/commands.
- `hosts/claude-code/` — full; everything including hooks payload + slash command.

## Recipe 2 — Adding a stage

You want to insert a new stage (e.g. an accessibility audit between QA and sign-off).

1. **Define the stage in `core/pipeline/stages.js`.** Choose:
   - `stage` id (e.g. `"stage-06a"` or `"stage-08b"`). Numbering convention: `stage-NN` for top-level, `stage-NNa`/`stage-NNb` for sub-stages of NN.
   - `roles` — array. Single role = `["platform"]`. Multi-role = `["backend", "frontend", "platform", "qa"]`.
   - `objective`, `readFirst`, `allowedWrites`, `artifact`, `template`, `gate` (skeleton).
   - Optional: `roleWrites` (per-role allowedWrites map), `subagent` (forces all workstreams to a named subagent), `conditionalOn` ({stage, field, equals} — skip unless prereq matches).

2. **Add to `ORDERED_STAGE_NAMES`** at the right position.

3. **Add to `STAGES_BY_TRACK`** for each track that should run it. Conditional stages still need to be in the track list — the conditional skip happens at runtime, not at track filtering.

4. **Create the gate schema** at `core/gates/schemas/<stage>.schema.json`. Stage-specific required fields only — the base fields (`stage`, `status`, `orchestrator`, …) come from `gate.schema.json`.

5. **Add a `## Gate` section to `rules/stage-NN.md`** documenting the gate body for the new stage with a JSON example (field names matching the `gate:` skeleton in `stages.js`). The universal contract is in `rules/gates-core.md` — only per-stage extra fields go in the stage file.

6. **Add a per-stage rules file** at `rules/stage-NN.md` (e.g. `stage-04d.md` for a new sub-stage between 4c and 5). Add a row to the index table in `rules/pipeline-build.md` pointing at it. For stages 1–3 or 9, append the section to `pipeline-core.md` instead. For track-level behavior, edit `pipeline-tracks.md`.

7. **If the stage needs a new role**, see Recipe 3.

8. **Verify locally.**
   ```bash
   ./bin/devteam stages                   # new name appears
   TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
   ./bin/devteam init --host claude-code --cwd "$TMPDIR"
   ./bin/devteam stage <name> --cwd "$TMPDIR"   # prompt renders
   ```

## Recipe 3 — Adding a role

You want a new role (e.g. `compliance`, `accessibility`, `data-engineer`).

1. **Write the host-neutral role brief** at `roles/<role>.md`. Use existing briefs as templates. Structure:
   - Opening paragraph: who you are, what you own, what you don't.
   - `## Read First` — files the role reads at start of any task.
   - `## Writes` — paths the role writes to.
   - `## Handoff` — what gets passed to the next stage.
   - `## Standing Rules`, `## Gate Writing Rules`, `## Escalation Triggers` — the operational rules.

2. **Update each adapter that uses subagents** (currently `hosts/claude-code/adapter.js`). Add an entry to `ROLE_FRONTMATTER`:
   ```js
   <role>: {
     name: "dev-<role>",                  // or just the role name
     description: "...",
     tools: "Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash",
     model: "sonnet",                     // or "opus" / "haiku"
     permissionMode: "acceptEdits",
   }
   ```

3. **Reference from at least one stage's `roles` array** in `stages.js`. A role with no stage assignment is dead code.

4. **If the role uses a different subagent than its name** (like peer-review's `subagent: "reviewer"`), declare that on the stage, not on the role.

5. **Update `rules/orchestrator.md`** to list the role under `## The Team`.

6. **Verify.**
   ```bash
   ./bin/devteam stage <stage-using-the-role> --cwd "$TMPDIR"
   # Prompt should say "Use the <name> subagent (.claude/agents/<name>.md)"
   ```

## Recipe 4 — Adding a skill

Skills are task-oriented helpers the LLM consults for specific tasks (writing code to a convention, running a self-review, etc.). They are host-neutral.

1. **Create the skill directory** at `skills/<name>/` with at minimum a `SKILL.md`. Optional sub-files for examples or longer explanations.

2. **Skill front-matter (`SKILL.md`)** doesn't need YAML headers — adapters add host-specific wrappers if needed. Just write the body as plain markdown:
   ```markdown
   # <Skill Name>

   Use this skill when …

   ## Inputs
   - …

   ## Steps
   1. …
   ```

3. **No registration needed.** Both `hosts/claude-code/adapter.js` and `hosts/codex/adapter.js` auto-iterate `skills/` and copy each directory into the host's expected skills path.

4. **Reference from a role brief if relevant.** Skills don't "fire" automatically — they have to be invoked. The role brief is where you tell the LLM "consult this skill when doing X."

5. **Verify.**
   ```bash
   TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
   ./bin/devteam init --host claude-code --cwd "$TMPDIR"
   ls "$TMPDIR/.claude/skills/<name>/"
   ```

## Recipe 5 — Adding a CHANGELOG fragment

Every PR that touches `core/`, `bin/`, `hosts/`, `rules/`, `roles/`, or `skills/` must include a `changelog.d/<slug>.md` entry. CI enforces this (`.github/workflows/test.yml`, `scripts/changelog-guard.js`).

1. **Pick a filename.** Use your branch name or PR slug: `changelog.d/feat-my-thing.md`. Each PR owns its own file — filenames never collide.

2. **Write the entry.** Use the same bullet style as existing `## [Unreleased]` entries in `CHANGELOG.md`. Long entries are encouraged — these bullets become the official release notes. Include an "Honest scope note" where the change has known limitations or deferred follow-ups.

   ```markdown
   - **Your change title** (closes BACKLOG XY). One paragraph describing what
     changed and why, in CHANGELOG bullet style. *Honest scope note:* known limits.
   ```

3. **Assemble at release time.** `node scripts/release.js assemble <version>` reads all `changelog.d/*.md` files (stable alphabetical order) plus any content under `[Unreleased]`, folds both into the new versioned section, and deletes the fragment files. `README.md` and `.gitkeep` in `changelog.d/` are never touched.

**Opt-out:** add `[skip-changelog]` to the PR title or any commit message on the branch (for refactors, test-only changes, or docs-only edits that CI misclassifies as touching guarded paths).

## Style guidance

- **No comments-as-documentation in code.** If a fact needs explaining and isn't obvious from the code, put it in a doc, not a multi-paragraph code comment. One-line "why this is here" comments are fine; docstrings aren't.
- **Strip version numbers from docs.** Stagecraft has no v1/v2/v3 — those are claude-dev-team's history. If you find a `(v2.X+)` annotation while editing, strip it.
- **Host-neutral first.** Anything that could go in shared (`roles/`, `rules/`, `skills/`, `templates/`, `core/`) and be rendered into host-specific paths by an adapter, should. Direct host-specific files only when there's no neutral form.
- **Path conventions.** `.devteam/` for the shared workspace in target projects. `AGENTS.md` for host-neutral context. `pipeline/` for artifacts. `pipeline/gates/<stage>.<workstream>.json` for workstream gates (dot separator, not hyphen).
- **No `agent` field.** Contract F removed it. Use `workstream` (role identity), `host` (adapter identity), `orchestrator` (orchestrator+version).

## Testing your change

```bash
npm test                  # ~1 200 tests, ~5s — run after every change
npm run consistency       # cross-artifact lint (stage names, gate filenames, track counts, …)
```

Manual smoke test against a temp target project (see Setup above) is still useful for end-to-end install verification. See [`docs/TESTING.md`](docs/TESTING.md) for the full test strategy and inventory.

If your change touches a load-bearing contract from `AGENTS.md`, add the test in lockstep with the code change.

## Commit & PR style

- One logical change per commit; conventional commit subject (no `feat:`/`fix:` prefix — descriptive style; see `git log --oneline`).
- Commit messages explain *why*, not just *what*. Diff shows what; commit message answers "why is this the right change?"
- Reference the doc you updated alongside the code (e.g. "updates ARCHITECTURE.md decision #5"). Doc + code in the same commit.
- Sign off with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 <noreply@anthropic.com>` if Claude helped.
- Don't `git add -A` or `git add .`. Stage by name to avoid accidentally committing `node_modules/` artifacts or scratch files.
- Any PR touching `core/`, `bin/`, `hosts/`, `rules/`, `roles/`, or `skills/` must include a `changelog.d/<slug>.md` entry. See [Recipe 5](#recipe-5--adding-a-changelog-fragment).

## Documentation principles

These govern where facts live and how they stay true. Write them into every doc change.

1. **One owner per fact.** Every class of fact has exactly one canonical home (see §3 of [`plans/documentation-plan.md`](plans/documentation-plan.md)); everywhere else links, never restates. A restatement is a bug.
2. **Generate, don't transcribe.** Any content derivable from code (stage tables, CLI flags, capability grids) is emitted by a script and fenced with `<!-- generated: do not hand-edit -->` markers that the consistency checker enforces.
3. **Docs are routed by audience, not topic.** Four named reader paths (Evaluator / Operator / Contributor / Model); every doc belongs to exactly one primary path.
4. **Model-facing prose is code.** `rules/`, `roles/`, `skills/` have a token budget per dispatch. A doc that bloats an agent's context is a performance regression.
5. **Drift fails CI.** `npm run consistency` is the enforcement arm of principles 1–4. A documentation rule without a check is a wish.

## Doc-update checklist

When you change code, update the docs that own the affected facts. A restatement anywhere else needs a corresponding link update, not a content change.

| If you changed… | Update… |
|---|---|
| `core/pipeline/stages.js` | Run `npm run docs:generate` (generates reference tables); update `rules/pipeline*.md` if stage behavior changed |
| A CLI flag or subcommand | Schema description *is* the doc — update the flag schema and help text; do not hand-edit `README.md` CLI table |
| A new feature | Add a row to [`docs/FEATURES.md`](docs/FEATURES.md) + add a `changelog.d/<slug>.md` fragment (CI-enforced for guarded paths) |
| A design decision | Add or update an ADR in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) and reference the decision number in `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `hosts/*/capabilities.json` | Run `npm run docs:generate` to regenerate the host-capability matrix |
| A BACKLOG item (landed) | Add a one-liner to [`docs/BACKLOG.md`](docs/BACKLOG.md) with a CHANGELOG link; remove the detailed strikethrough row |

## Archive policy

Anything superseded moves to `docs/historical/` rather than being half-updated in place. The consistency checker excludes `docs/historical/` from its prose-vs-code checks, so archived docs do not generate false drift alerts. Name archived files with a datestamp prefix (`YYYY-MM-DD-original-name.md`) so the archive is self-documenting. The [`docs/historical/`](docs/historical/) directory already uses this convention for the self-audit archive.

## Where to ask

- Design intent → `ARCHITECTURE.md`, then `docs/walkthroughs/`.
- Operational behavior → `docs/concepts.md`, then the relevant `rules/*.md`.
- "Why was X done this way?" → check the commit history first; the messages explain intent.

## Two anti-patterns

1. **Editing installed copies in a target project.** The single source of truth is `roles/`, `rules/`, and `skills/` in this repo. Target-project copies are rendered by adapters at install time. Edits to those rendered copies are lost on the next install.

2. **Introducing host-specific logic in `core/`.** The core never invokes a model and has no knowledge of `claude --print` or `codex exec`. Host-specific behavior goes in `hosts/<host>/adapter.js`. Shared host-behavior helpers go under `core/adapters/`.
