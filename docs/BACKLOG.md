# Backlog

A living list of work beyond the initial migration, organized into seven buckets. Each item carries a rough impact (1–5) and effort (1–5) score.

**How to read the scores.** Impact 5 = changes what users can do, not just how. Effort 5 = multi-week, touches several components, needs experimentation. Priority is not strictly impact÷effort — high-impact items are often worth doing even when expensive — but the ratio is a useful first filter.

**Cross-references.** Items tagged `[cmp-E-N]` were added or refined on 2026-06-03 after the comparative analysis against six adjacent AI-dev frameworks ([`comparative-analysis.md`](comparative-analysis.md)). Items tagged `[hist-N]` came from `audit-archive/HISTORY.md` § Between-cycle observations. Where multiple sources converge on the same idea, that's recorded inline.

## A. Reach — more hosts, more deployment targets

| # | Idea | I | E | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A2 | **Cursor / Windsurf / Aider / Cline adapters** | 3 | 3 | One per IDE-embedded agent. Each is an adapter, mostly install-payload work. |
| A3 | **Cloud-runner adapter** (e.g. AWS Lambda + Bedrock, Replit Agent) | 4 | 4 | Host adapter that runs one workstream on a remote worker, not the user's laptop. Enables long-running stages (multi-hour audits, big test suites). [Phase 21 plan proposed for review.](../plans/phase-21-cloud-runner-adapter.md) |
| A5 | **API-direct adapter** (no host CLI; talks to Anthropic / OpenAI / Google APIs directly) | 3 | 3 | For users who don't want to install claude-code or codex but still want orchestration. Lighter dependency footprint. |

## B. Pipeline depth — more/richer stages

No open items. B7 moved to [Shipped](#shipped) in Phase 19.

## C. Quality & safety — enforcement, sandboxing, scanning

| # | Idea | I | E | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | ~~Filesystem-level `allowedWrites` enforcement~~ | 4 | 4 | ✅ v0.6.0 · [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#060--2026-06-11) |
| C2 | ~~Secret scanning hook~~ | 4 | 1 | ✅ v0.2.0 · [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#020--2026-05-27) |
| C3 | ~~License compatibility gate~~ | 3 | 1 | ✅ v0.6.0 · [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#060--2026-06-11) |
| C4 | ~~Reproducible runs (recording half)~~ | 4 | 4 | ✅ v0.4.0 · [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#040--2026-05-28) |
| C5 | ~~Capability-required permissions~~ | 3 | 2 | ✅ v0.6.0 · [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#060--2026-06-11) |
| C6 | ~~Tamper-evident gate chain~~ | 3 | 3 | ✅ v0.6.0 · [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#060--2026-06-11) |
| C7 | ~~`eslint-plugin-security`~~ `[hist-a]` | 3 | 1 | ✅ v0.6.0 · [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#060--2026-06-11) |
| C8 | ~~CHANGELOG-per-PR fragments~~ `[hist-b]` | 3 | 2 | ✅ v0.6.0 · [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md#060--2026-06-11) |
| C9 | ~~**Verify-before-promoting enforcement in audit skill** `[hist-c]`~~ | 3 | 2 | ✅ Unreleased · Phase 1/2 audit findings now require `verified_by` evidence, templates expose verification slots, and structural tests lock the contract. |

## D. Observability & learning — telemetry, metrics, persistent learning

| # | Idea | I | E | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D5 | **D5 maturation — continuous adaptive routing** | 5 | 3 | Today D5 proposes role-level swaps; the mature form re-routes the *next* run based on the prior run's outcomes automatically. Phase 17 makes per-workstream dispatch history durable and privacy-bounded; the gate stays shut pending ≥5 dispatches per (role, host) pair across ≥2 real user projects and cost telemetry. |

## E. Developer experience

| # | Idea | I | E | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| E3 | **VS Code extension** | 3 | 3 | Sidebar with stage status, "run next stage" button, gate viewer. |
| E9 | **Conversational stage mode** `[cmp-E-4]` | 3 | 3 | `devteam stage requirements --interactive` opens a conversation with the PM subagent to refine the brief through Q&A before producing the artifact. Useful specifically for upstream stages (requirements, design, clarification) where the artifact benefits from refinement before being rendered. Architecture supports it (adapters could expose streaming-conversation alongside one-shot render). Implement if user feedback indicates the gate-driven loop is too rigid for upstream stages. Related to E7 but different mechanism: E7 is host-loops-until-condition; E9 is stage-manager-converses-with-agent. |

## F. Integrations — where the team plugs in

| # | Idea | I | E | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F2 | **Jira/Linear ticket integration** | 3 | 2 | `devteam stage requirements --ticket FOO-123` pulls the ticket as the feature brief input. Gates link back to the ticket. |
| F3 | **Slack/Discord notifications** | 3 | 1 | Pipeline events (stage start, fail, escalate) post to a channel. Triggers for human checkpoints. |
| F5 | **Pre-commit hook integration** | 3 | 1 | Optional pre-commit hook that runs the relevant track for the change (nano if config-only, full if otherwise). |

## G. Innovation bets — speculative, future-oriented

These don't fit neatly in impact/effort because their value depends on how the field evolves. They are the items that would most meaningfully differentiate this tool.

### G5. Multi-modal stages
Design specs include architecture diagrams (images). Stage 2 (design) and Stage 5 (review) accept image inputs. Principal can output a system diagram, not just prose. Visual reasoning is no longer a separate workflow.

### G9. Self-modifying pipeline
Retrospective stage proposes changes to `stages.js` / `roles/` / `rules/` based on what worked. Proposals queue for human approval. The pipeline learns its own shape from operation.

---

## Priority queue (2026-06-19 — Phase 19 closeout)

The full evidence, effort/risk ratings, dependencies, and PR sequence now live in the
[current audit backlog](audit/09-backlog.md) and [roadmap](audit/10-roadmap.md).

### Immediate and near-term

No ungated implementation item remains from the audit's immediate and targeted
improvement batches. Phase 16 completed privacy-safe readiness/export, Phase 17 made
dispatch evidence durable, Phase 18 added explicit accepted-resolution evidence for
H3, Phase 19 shipped polyglot verification in PR #264, and Phase 20 implements the
separable `devteam run --watch` operator UX without enabling active stall response. The
next capability horizon is real collection followed by review, not calendar-driven
activation. E9 conversational stage mode remains a discovery proposal until five real
users report upstream rigidity.

Completed from this audit cycle: dashboard HTML safety and lifecycle (PR #235),
native Windows CI evidence, support wording, and A6 promotion (PR #236), and bounded
durable transcript streaming (PR #237). Current-truth reconciliation removed the
remaining P1-3 ownership, vocabulary, comment, count, link, and provider drift.
Stable-fact consistency now locks schema vocabulary, Node/platform support, and the
absence of volatile test totals while leaving audit history untouched (audit P2-3).
The autonomous driver decomposition is complete: characterization, dispatch/transient,
and fix/ruling/merge transitions landed as three behavior-preserving slices while
`run()` retained lock, loop, effect, and final-persistence ownership (audit P2-2).

### Evidence-gated next horizon

- **P3-1 — evidence readiness and export.** Phase 16 implements the approved privacy
  model, read-only local readiness, consented aggregate export, identity lifecycle,
  strict bundle validation, and explicit multi-project analysis. See
  [`plans/phase-16-evidence-readiness-and-export.md`](../plans/phase-16-evidence-readiness-and-export.md).
  Phase 17 adds allowlisted per-workstream dispatch events so D5 evidence accumulates
  during normal autonomous runs without reconstructing history from gate snapshots.
  See [`plans/phase-17-durable-evidence-instrumentation.md`](../plans/phase-17-durable-evidence-instrumentation.md).
  Phase 18 adds explicit, hash-bound human acceptance for successful fix/retry
  resolutions so H3's derivability threshold can be measured without exporting recipe
  text. See [`plans/phase-18-accepted-resolution-evidence.md`](../plans/phase-18-accepted-resolution-evidence.md).
  This makes the gates below measurable; it does not open them.

- **D5 maturation — continuous adaptive routing.** Today D5 proposes role-level swaps; the mature form re-routes the *next* run based on the prior run's outcomes automatically. **Evidence baseline (2026-06-14, `plans/adaptive-routing-evidence.md`):** zero real-run telemetry at review time. Phase 17 starts durable collection from real autonomous dispatches; it does not backfill old gates. Gate stays shut pending ≥5 durable dispatches per (role, host) pair across ≥2 real user projects and cost telemetry. ADR-007 Tier 1 (liveness heartbeat + observe-only stall probe) implemented in Phase 11.1; ADR-008 (advisory sweep + `--fail-on-advisory`) implemented in Phase 11.2; ADR-007 Tier 2 remains evidence-gated.
- **H3 — Recipe factory (escalation→recipe learning)** (Phase 3 of [ADR-003](adr/003-bounded-autonomous-execution.md) · [design](autonomous-execution-design.md)). Persist resolved escalations as semantically-indexed fix-recipes via the existing `core/memory/` embedding store (D7); `computeFixSteps` consults it on a FAIL signature before escalating, so recurring *derivable* failures resolve deterministically. **Evidence review done (2026-06-14, `plans/h3-ground-truth.md`):** zero real run logs/archives and no recurring unresolved class. Phase 18 makes explicit acceptance measurable under ADR-012. Gate stays shut pending ≥2 real projects each with ≥5 autonomous fix/retry runs, the same schema-bound failure accepted ≥3 times across both projects, and ≥80% derivability. Tracked by GitHub #142.
- **ADR-005 standing grants.** Keep deferred until at least 10 repair runs across 2+
  projects and consequence-ceiling halt data establish which grants operators routinely
  approve. Tracked by GitHub #144.
- **ADR-007 Tier 2 active stall response.** Keep deferred until real
  `stall-detected` events calibrate frequency and threshold. Tracked by GitHub #145.

### Consciously deprioritized

Five items that the comparative analysis or shifted context argues against investing in now:

- **E3 — VS Code extension.** Stagecraft sits above the IDE, not inside it. Building an editor extension works against that positioning, and IDE-native tooling is a crowded category.
- **A2 — Cursor/Windsurf/Aider/Cline adapters.** Supporting 30+ AI agents is a maintenance treadmill. Land **A4 — Pluggable adapter discovery** first and let the long tail be community-built.
- **F2 / F3 / F5 — Jira / Slack / pre-commit integration.** None changes what Stagecraft can do. Accept community PRs but don't invest core time.
- **G9 — Self-modifying pipeline.** Premature. Wait until multiple teams use the platform in different configurations before optimizing for any one signal.

## Staying ahead of the curve — bets

Six positioning bets about where software development is heading.

### 1. Models keep getting smarter, cheaper, faster.
Design the contract assuming 10× capability in 2 years. The schema (gate JSON), the seam (per-workstream gates merged to stage), and the routing layer should outlive the specific models we route to today.

### 2. Diversity beats monoculture.
Single-model agentic systems are giving way to multi-model coordinated systems. For non-trivial tasks, the stronger outcome usually involves 2–3 different model families. The routing layer is already built for this; the next step is making diversity structurally load-bearing (G1 multi-model peer review, D4/D5 adaptive routing).

### 3. Evals are the rate-limit.
The pipeline produces structured gate JSON so evals can be built on top. Every refinement should make the gate richer and more measurable. D1/D2/D4 are all expressions of this bet.

### 4. Memory and persistence are the next frontier.
Today's pipeline is mostly stateless within a run; each new run starts fresh. Sustained coordination across projects, with continuous learning, requires the work in D3/D7/G8.

### 5. Tool depth beats raw intelligence.
An agent with a deep, well-composed tool stack outperforms one that only writes text. Role briefs are the place to encode tool budgets per role (G10). Skills are early steps; tool negotiation is the mature form.

### 6. Compliance and auditability are coming, fast.
EU AI Act, US executive orders, SOC 2 controls: all require reproducible runs, audit trails, and documented decision provenance. C4 (reproducible runs), C6 (tamper-evident gate chain), and D1 (tracing) address this directly.

### The unit is the team, not the model.
A coordinated team of specialized agents — each with a role, a tool budget, a gate contract, and shared memory — outperforms a single model. The model is a substrate. The team is the product.
