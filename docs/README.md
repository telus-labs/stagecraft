# docs/

Navigation index for the `docs/` directory. Nothing here is load-bearing for a pipeline run — models read `AGENTS.md`, `rules/`, `roles/`, and `skills/` only.

## Model — never reads docs/

Models read `AGENTS.md` + `rules/` + `roles/` + `skills/` only. Nothing in this directory is loaded during a pipeline run.
