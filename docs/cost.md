# Cost telemetry

Stagecraft records per-workstream LLM cost in the gate JSON, and aggregates it in the dashboard. Cost data is **opt-in per gate** — when the model or agent knows its own token usage, it writes it into the gate; downstream tooling rolls up dollars from there.

This is the **D6** BACKLOG item — foundation for D4 (per-role per-model performance scores) and D5 (adaptive routing). On its own it answers "where did our LLM spend go this sprint?"

## Quick start

```bash
# After running a pipeline (or many):
npm run dashboard:cost                               # cost rolled up by host
node scripts/dashboard.js --view cost --by role      # cost by role
node scripts/dashboard.js --view cost --by stage     # cost by stage
node scripts/dashboard.js --view cost --from p1,p2   # multi-project rollup
node scripts/dashboard.js --view cost --json         # machine-readable
```

Output:

```
# devteam dashboard — cost view

## How cost gets into the gate

Cost is opt-in. The gate JSON gains five optional fields:

| Field | Type | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `model` | string | Specific model id, e.g. `claude-opus-4-7` (distinct from `host`). |
| `tokens_in` | number | Input tokens (prompt + history). |
| `tokens_out` | number | Output tokens generated. |
| `duration_ms` | number | Wall-clock for this dispatch. |
| `cost_usd` | number | Computed from the above + `core/pricing.js`. |

Three ways the fields land:

1. **Agent self-reports.** The renderStagePrompt for each host now includes an "Optional cost telemetry" note asking the agent to include `model` / `tokens_in` / `tokens_out` / `duration_ms` if it knows them. Claude exposes these in its CLI output; the agent can read them and write them into the gate.
2. **Adapter post-processes** (future work). The headless invoke path could parse `--output-format json` from the host CLI and write the fields into the gate as a post-step. Not implemented today; the agent-self-report path covers the same data.
3. **Stage-merge rollup** (orchestrator). When `devteam merge <stage>` aggregates per-workstream gates, it sums any cost fields present and emits stage-level `tokens_in` / `tokens_out` / `cost_usd` / `duration_ms` totals on the merged gate. Per-workstream detail is preserved inside the `workstreams[]` array.

## Pricing table

`core/pricing.js` carries a hardcoded $/Mtok table for known models. Today it covers:

- **Claude 4 family** — Opus, Sonnet, Haiku
- **OpenAI** — GPT-5, GPT-4o, o1 (and their mini variants)
- **Gemini 2.5** — Pro, Flash

Lookup is exact-match first, then prefix-match — so a dated model id like `claude-opus-4-7-20250515` still resolves to the `claude-opus-4-7` row. Unknown models compute `cost_usd: null` (tokens still aggregate).

**The pricing is an estimate, not an invoice.** Prices change; update `core/pricing.js` periodically. Authoritative billing lives in each provider's dashboard.

## What cost data unlocks

D6 alone answers "where did the money go" — but it's the data layer for two follow-on features:

- **D4 — Per-role per-model performance scores.** For each `(role, host)` pair, compute first-try pass rate, mean retries, mean cost. Surfaces "Codex is cheaper than Claude at backend AND passes first try more often."
- **D5 — Adaptive routing.** Take D4's data, recommend or auto-apply routing changes. `devteam routing suggest` outputs a YAML diff for `.devteam/config.yml`.

Together they realize the "diversity beats monoculture" bet from `docs/BACKLOG.md` — the system learns which model is best at which role, not by guessing but by measuring.

## Limitations

- **Token reporting is uneven** across host CLIs. Claude Code exposes precise counts via `--print --output-format json`; Codex and Gemini are less consistent. The simpler model in agent-self-reports gives us the data without per-host parsing complexity.
- **Pricing drift.** The pricing table needs periodic updates. If prices change between updates, `cost_usd` figures are off by the drift.
- **Cached input tokens** (Claude's prompt caching, GPT's similar feature) aren't tracked separately. The reported `tokens_in` includes everything; cost calculations don't apply cache discounts. Treat as upper bound.
- **No latency-cost decomposition.** A slow stage and an expensive stage are different things. `duration_ms` and `cost_usd` are both reported, but no derived "$/min" metric — the dashboard table includes both so you can read what matters.
