# Prompt Budget Reference

Framework prose loaded by every model dispatch — derived from `readFirst` arrays in
`core/pipeline/stages.js`. **Token estimate: bytes ÷ 4** (conservative floor; GPT/Claude
tokenizers average ~3.5–4 bytes/token for English prose).

**Included:** `AGENTS.md`, `rules/` files mapped from `.devteam/rules/`, and the role brief
for each dispatched role.
**Excluded:** `pipeline/*` artifacts (project-dependent, unknown at analysis time).

Run `npm run docs:generate` to regenerate after editing stages.js, rules/, or roles/.

## Per-dispatch framework cost

Multi-role stages appear once per dispatched role. The CI advisory
(`npm run consistency`) warns when any stage's max-dispatch bytes grow >10%.

## Top 5 heaviest framework files

| File                | Bytes  | Tokens~ |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| roles/principal.md  | 14,820 | 3705    |
| roles/red-team.md   | 13,683 | 3421    |
| roles/pm.md         | 10,618 | 2655    |
| roles/verifier.md   | 9,089  | 2273    |
| roles/migrations.md | 8,272  | 2068    |

## Advisory file-size ceilings

`scripts/consistency.js` emits advisories when these ceilings are exceeded.
Advisories are non-blocking (they print but do not fail CI).

| File class         | Ceiling |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| Role brief         | 16 KB   |
| Stage rule file    | 8 KB    |
| AGENTS.md          | 10 KB   |

## Runtime changed-file manifest

Each dispatch may also include a compact changed-file manifest with paths, byte sizes,
and SHA-256 digests only. It is intentionally excluded from the framework growth guard
because it is project/runtime dependent, but it is bounded and measurable.

| Limit | Estimated bytes | Tokens~ |
| ----- | --------------- | ------- |
| 40 files | 5,988 | 1497 |

This replaces eager changed-file content loading: agents inspect file bodies on demand
when the manifest shows a relevant path or digest change.

Framework-owned paths never enter it: Stagecraft's own state and every host install
surface `devteam init` writes. The same predicate filters right-sizing's role
inference and the file list `assess` scores a track from — see
`FRAMEWORK_OWNED_PREFIXES` in [`core/paths.js`](../../core/paths.js).
