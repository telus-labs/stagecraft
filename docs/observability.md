# Observability

Stagecraft emits [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) spans for every pipeline operation. Any OTLP/HTTP-compatible backend works: Jaeger, Tempo, Honeycomb, Datadog, New Relic, and others.

## Quick start

Tracing is **opt-in**. With no environment variables set, the orchestrator uses OTel's no-op tracer with zero runtime overhead.

To enable tracing, set the standard OTel endpoint:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
devteam stage build
```

The OTLP HTTP exporter ships spans to that endpoint.

## Local Jaeger in 30 seconds

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name jaeger \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest

export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
devteam stage requirements --feature "test"
# → open http://localhost:16686, search service "devteam"
```

## Environment variables

All standard [OTel env vars](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/) work. The ones you'll typically set:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | (unset → no tracing) | Where to ship spans. e.g. `http://localhost:4318` for local Jaeger, `https://api.honeycomb.io` for Honeycomb. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | (unset) | Trace-specific override of the above. |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` | (unset) | Auth headers, e.g. `x-honeycomb-team=YOUR_KEY` |
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | `devteam` | Service name shown in your tracing UI. |
| `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` | (unset) | Comma-separated `k=v` pairs, e.g. `deployment.environment=staging,team=infra` |
| `DEVTEAM_OTEL_DISABLE` | `0` | Force-disable even if the endpoint is set. Useful in tests. |

## What gets traced

The orchestrator emits spans for every significant operation. A `devteam stage build` run for a multi-role stage produces:

```
pipeline.stage                   stage="stage-04" track="full" workstream_count=4
├── pipeline.workstream          role="backend" workstream.id="stage-04.backend"
│   └── adapter.renderStagePrompt   host="codex"
├── pipeline.workstream          role="frontend" workstream.id="stage-04.frontend"
│   └── adapter.renderStagePrompt   host="claude-code"
├── pipeline.workstream          role="platform" workstream.id="stage-04.platform"
│   └── adapter.renderStagePrompt   host="claude-code"
└── pipeline.workstream          role="qa" workstream.id="stage-04.qa"
    └── adapter.renderStagePrompt   host="claude-code"
```

Other spans:

| Span name | When | Key attributes |
|---|---|---|
| `pipeline.stage` | Every `devteam stage <name>` | `devteam.stage`, `devteam.stage.name`, `devteam.track`, `devteam.workstream_count`, `devteam.feature` |
| `pipeline.stage.headless` | Every `devteam stage <name> --headless` | Same as above + per-workstream `adapter.invoke` children |
| `pipeline.workstream` | Each role within a multi-role stage (or once for single-role) | `devteam.workstream.role`, `devteam.host`, `devteam.workstream.id` |
| `adapter.renderStagePrompt` | When the orchestrator asks an adapter to render the prompt | `devteam.host`, `devteam.workstream.role` |
| `adapter.invoke` | Headless host-CLI invocation | `devteam.host`, `devteam.workstream.role`, `devteam.invoke.exit_code`, `devteam.invoke.duration_ms`, `devteam.invoke.gate_written` |
| `pipeline.merge` | `devteam merge <stage>` | `devteam.stage`, `devteam.merge.result` (`merged` or `missing`), `devteam.merge.status`, `devteam.merge.blockers_count`, `devteam.merge.warnings_count` |
| `pipeline.next` | `devteam next` | `devteam.track`, `devteam.next.action`, `devteam.next.stage`, `devteam.next.name` |

Exceptions are captured automatically. If anything throws, the span gets `status=ERROR` and the exception is recorded as a span event.

## What's NOT traced (yet)

- **The validator** (`core/gates/validator.js`) — runs as a short-lived child process and calls `process.exit()` on every branch. Tracing it cleanly requires a refactor. The orchestrator traces validate calls it makes itself via the `pipeline.next` and `pipeline.merge` spans.
- **The approval-derivation hook** — same situation; spawned by Claude Code's PostToolUse hook, exits immediately.
- **LLM calls themselves** — Stagecraft does not make these. The host (Claude Code, Codex) does, and their tracing surface is their own. Stagecraft observes what they wrote to gate files.

These spans are consumed by the shipped analytics tools — see `scripts/dashboard.js` (`--view cost`, `--view performance`) and `scripts/routing-suggest.js`.

## Pipeline log JSON

`devteam log --json` emits newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON): one event object per line, ordered by event mtime. This is intended for lightweight dashboards and shell pipelines that do not need full OpenTelemetry ingestion.

Every event has these fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ts` | string | Event mtime as an ISO-8601 timestamp. |
| `kind` | string | Event type: `gate` or `artifact`. |
| `path` | string | Project-relative path with `/` separators. |

Gate events add:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `stage` | string | Gate `stage` field, for example `stage-04`. |
| `workstream` | string or null | Gate `workstream` field when present. Stage-level merged gates may omit it. |
| `status` | string | Gate status such as `PASS`, `WARN`, `FAIL`, or `ESCALATE`. |

Artifact events add:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `owner` | string or null | Inferred owner role, when known. |
| `artifactKind` | string | Artifact category, for example `brief`, `pr`, `review`, or `adr`. |

Example:

```json
{"ts":"2026-06-02T10:00:00.000Z","kind":"gate","path":"pipeline/gates/stage-01.json","stage":"stage-01","workstream":"pm","status":"PASS"}
{"ts":"2026-06-02T10:01:00.000Z","kind":"artifact","path":"pipeline/brief.md","owner":"pm","artifactKind":"brief"}
```

When `--follow` is combined with `--json`, newly discovered events use the same object shape. Consumers should parse line-by-line and ignore unknown future fields.

## Run corpus

Every headless dispatch (`devteam run`, `devteam stage <name> --headless`,
`devteam replay`, the a11y-fixer) appends one sanitized JSON line to
`.devteam/corpus/dispatches.jsonl` — project-local, gitignored by the
managed block (`core/gitignore.js`), never uploaded (phase-28 item 28.5,
[`plans/phase-28-ground-truth-telemetry.md`](../plans/phase-28-ground-truth-telemetry.md)
§28.5). This is the substrate for D5 (adaptive routing) and H3 (recipe
factory), both evidence-gated pending real dispatch history — see
[`docs/BACKLOG.md`](BACKLOG.md).

Each record:

```json
{"ts":"2026-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","run_id":"2026-07-31T00:00:00.000Z","stage":"stage-04","role":"backend","host":"claude-code","model_observed":"claude-sonnet-5","model_requested":"claude-sonnet-5","prompt_pack_version":"32419bc9c408","track":"full","prompt_hash":"a1b2...","prompt_bytes":4213,"tokens_in":1234,"tokens_out":56,"cost_usd":0.0456,"cost_basis":"observed","duration_ms":18234,"queue_ms":0,"gate_status":"PASS","blockers":null,"retry_of":null,"framework_version":"0.9.0"}
```

Fields missing for a given dispatch are `null`, never omitted, so consumers can rely on a stable shape.

- `model_observed`, `tokens_in`/`tokens_out`, `cost_usd` prefer the gate's
  `_orchestrator_observed` block (orchestrator-parsed CLI/API output — see
  items 28.1–28.3) over the model-asserted top-level gate fields.
  `cost_basis` records which one won: `"observed"` (host-reported), `"derived"` (priced from observed tokens via `core/pricing.js` — omp, codex), or `"model-asserted"`
  (`null` when neither is present).
- `blockers` is sanitized through the same secret-scan path
  (`core/hooks/secret-scan.js scanContent`, reused by `core/patterns.js`
  collection) used elsewhere in the project — a blocker containing
  secret-shaped text is fully redacted, never partially leaked.
- `retry_of` is sourced from the gate's model-written `retry_number` — a
  claim, not an orchestrator observation, since there's no orchestrator-
  tracked per-dispatch retry-chain id today.
- `prompt_pack_version` (phase-33 item 33.3) is a content-hash version of
  the prompt surface (`core/prompt-pack.js` — sha256 over roles/ + rules/ +
  templates/), orchestrator-computed and read straight off the dispatch's
  gate. `devteam evals compare --pack <A> --pack <B>` filters this corpus
  by the field to report per-stage pass-rate deltas between two prompt-pack
  versions — see [`docs/reproducibility.md`](reproducibility.md).
- Writes are fire-and-forget: an unwritable `.devteam/corpus/` directory
  logs one warning and never fails the run (`core/corpus.js`
  `appendDispatchRecord`).

### `devteam corpus stats`

```
devteam corpus stats [--json]
```

Summarizes the corpus: total dispatches, per-stage pass rates, and
per-(role, host) dispatch counts — worded to answer the D5/H3
evidence-gate questions directly, for this project. D5/H3 also require
evidence across ≥2 real projects; run `corpus stats` per project and
combine manually — the corpus itself is never aggregated across projects
automatically (privacy model: local-only).

`scripts/routing-suggest.js` (D5) reads the corpus as an additional data
source alongside `pipeline/gates/` archives, so dispatch history survives
gate archiving/pruning.

## Eval flywheel capture

Every gate FAIL/ESCALATE, and every orchestrator stamp `status_overridden`
(the model-lied class — always captured, since it's already a FAIL), writes
a replayable case under `.devteam/evals/cases/<ts>-<stage>-<hash>/`
(phase-33 item 33.1,
[`plans/phase-33-eval-flywheel.md`](../plans/phase-33-eval-flywheel.md)
§33.1). Local-only and project-scoped — same privacy model as the run
corpus above.

Each case directory:

- `case.json` — stage/role/host/track, the orchestrator-computed
  `prompt_hash`, the gate's C4 reproducibility fields
  (`core/reproducibility.js`), a sanitized gate snapshot (blockers/warnings
  run through the same secret-scan path as the run corpus), and
  framework/stamper versions.
- `inputs/manifest.json` — the stage's `readFirst` artifact set,
  content-addressed by sha256 into `.devteam/evals/blobs/` and deduped
  across every case that snapshots the same content. A file that scans
  positive for a secret (`core/hooks/secret-scan.js`, the same path the
  stage-04c mechanical red-team floor uses) is excluded — never written to
  a blob — and the manifest records the exclusion reason instead.
- `resolution.json` — appended later by a run-end resolution-linker pass
  (fire-and-forget, alongside pattern auto-collection/reflector/
  memory-ingest in `core/driver.js`): once a `fix-retry` run-log event for
  the same stage is followed by that stage's gate no longer being
  FAIL/ESCALATE, the retry that cleared it is recorded here.

Config: `evals.capture` (default `true`) in `.devteam/config.yml` — set to
`false` to opt a proprietary-source project out entirely.

```
devteam evals gc [--json]
```

Removes `.devteam/evals/blobs/` entries no case's `inputs/manifest.json`
references anymore (e.g. after manually deleting a case directory).

## Cross-run performance calibration

`devteam performance calibration` aggregates the local dispatch corpus and durable run log
into sample-counted p50/p95 latency, cost provenance, cost per successful dispatch/run and
accepted resolution, cache hits, knowledge-pack selection correlation, track-fit feedback,
and the exact Phase 41 readiness thresholds. Add another local project without uploading
data:

```bash
devteam performance calibration --input ../another-project
devteam performance calibration --input ../another-project --json
```

Project paths are replaced by stable private references in the report. Estimates remain
separate from provider-observed cost, every percentile carries a denominator, and fixture
data must not be represented as real-project evidence.

After a run, record whether assessed ceremony fit using bounded values rather than a free
text transcript:

```bash
devteam performance feedback --fit right --reason latency
# fit: too-light | right | too-heavy
```

Use `devteam log --timeline` for one durable queue/invoke/verification/retry/reconciliation/
blocker view derived from `run-log.jsonl`.

The repeatable two-project protocol is in
[Dogfooding Stagecraft](guides/dogfooding.md#two-project-calibration-protocol). Missing
verification/reconciliation/blocker durations remain `null`; the report does not invent
timings from event order. Knowledge item-use coverage is likewise reported as unavailable
until a host exposes a trustworthy usage signal.

## Evidence collection horizon

OpenTelemetry is useful when a tracing backend is configured, but it is not the
whole operator experience. Phase 39 completed the useful measurement and live-timeline
portion of the older Phase 26 plan. The related implementation issues are retained here
for provenance:

- [#312](https://github.com/telus-labs/stagecraft/issues/312) — parent performance,
  observability, and run-usability overhaul
- [#313](https://github.com/telus-labs/stagecraft/issues/313) — critical-path
  telemetry and coverage report. The first slice adds
  `devteam performance critical-path`, backed by durable `run-log.jsonl` events:
  dispatch start/finish, merge start/finish, retry delay, workstream lifecycle,
  queue wait, telemetry coverage, and repeated orchestrator-stamped
  verification-command candidates.
- [#314](https://github.com/telus-labs/stagecraft/issues/314) — rich live run
  narrative, status, and logs. The first slice is implemented: `devteam run`
  emits per-workstream start/finish lines, `run-log.jsonl` records
  `workstream-started` / `workstream-finished`, `run-state.json` tracks
  `active_workstreams` and `last_workstream`, `devteam run --watch` shows active
  workstreams and artifact pointers, and `devteam status --verbose` exposes the
  same state for post-hoc inspection.

The remaining work is real-project collection for Phase 41. Deeper verification and
stamping substeps stay explicitly nullable: today the critical-path report can detect
repeated stamped commands and dispatch/merge
wall time, but individual stamp phases are still summarized inside gate metadata
rather than streamed as first-class run-log events.

## Backend-specific cookbooks

### Honeycomb

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-honeycomb-team=YOUR_API_KEY
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=devteam-${USER}
devteam stage build
# → Honeycomb dataset "devteam-${USER}"
```

### Datadog (via the agent)

Run the Datadog Agent locally with OTLP enabled, then:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=devteam
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment=staging
devteam stage build
```

### Console exporter (for debugging the trace itself)

The current SDK setup ships to OTLP only. For raw stdout output, override at the SDK level. This is outside the framework's default configuration but easily customizable in `core/observability.js`.

## Testing your instrumentation

`tests/observability.test.js` exercises the orchestrator span tree with an `InMemorySpanExporter`. To add a new instrumented operation:

1. Wrap the operation in `withSpan("name", attrs, () => ...)` from `core/observability.js`.
2. Add an assertion in `tests/observability.test.js` that runs the operation through a test tracer provider and verifies the expected span name + attributes.
3. Document the new span in this file's "What gets traced" table.

## Cost / overhead

When unconfigured, tracing uses OTel's no-op tracer: a single function call that returns immediately. Overhead is negligible.

When configured, span creation and attribute attachment are on the hot path. Because `pipeline.stage` wraps CLI commands that take seconds to minutes, the OTel overhead is in the microsecond range. Negligible.

The OTLP HTTP exporter buffers spans and flushes on a background timer and on process exit. The framework wires `beforeExit`, `SIGINT`, and `SIGTERM` handlers to call `sdk.shutdown()`, but sub-second runs can still lose the tail of a trace. Normal orchestrator usage is long-lived enough that this rarely matters.
