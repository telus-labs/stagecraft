# Stage 5 — Peer Code Review (Agent Teams preferred, sequential fallback)

### Review shape — scoped vs matrix

Before Stage 5 begins, the orchestrator inspects the diff and picks one
of two review shapes, then writes the chosen shape into each stage-05
gate's `"review_shape"` and `"required_approvals"` fields.

**Scoped review** — `review_shape: "scoped"`, `required_approvals: 1`.

Used when the diff is **area-contained**: every changed file lives under
one of `src/backend/`, `src/frontend/`, `src/infra/`, or `src/tests/`,
with no cross-area edits. One reviewer from a different area is
sufficient. The pairing uses the same cross-area convention as the `quick` track.

**Gate pre-creation (required for scoped reviews).** The orchestrator must
write `pipeline/gates/stage-05.{area}.json` with `"required_approvals": 1`
and `"review_shape": "scoped"` before invoking the reviewer. The hook
defaults new gates to `required_approvals: 2`; if the gate doesn't pre-exist
with the correct value, a single approval never flips the status to PASS.

| Owning area    | Default reviewer     |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `src/backend/` | `dev-platform`       |
| `src/frontend/`| `dev-backend`        |
| `src/infra/`   | `dev-backend`        |
| `src/tests/`   | `dev-backend`        |

If Stage 4.5b fired, the `security-engineer` review is a **second signal**
on the same gate — it does not substitute for the cross-area reviewer,
but it does count toward `required_approvals` in scoped mode. The veto
semantics of 4.5b still override: a `veto: true` halts the pipeline
regardless of Stage 5 approvals.

**Matrix review** — `review_shape: "matrix"`, `required_approvals: 2`.

Used when the diff touches more than one area. Each reviewer writes
exactly two `## Review of <area>` sections — never their own workstream.

| Role (file)       | Writes sections for     |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| `dev-backend`     | `platform` + `qa`       |
| `dev-frontend`    | `backend` + `qa`        |
| `dev-platform`    | `backend` + `frontend`  |
| `dev-qa`          | `frontend` + `platform` |

Coverage: every workstream receives exactly 2 approvals from distinct reviewers:
- `backend`:  dev-frontend + dev-platform
- `frontend`: dev-platform + dev-qa
- `platform`: dev-backend + dev-qa
- `qa`:       dev-backend + dev-frontend

**Self-review is invalid.** A reviewer MUST NOT write a `## Review of <area>`
section for the workstream they own — the hook skips and warns on self-reviews.

**Stage manager guidance — FAIL with no `changes_requested`.** When a gate shows
`status: "FAIL"` and `changes_requested` is empty, it means quorum has not
been reached — no one has blocked the change. Steps:

1. Run `devteam derive-approvals` first. The hook processes all existing
   `by-*.md` files; approvals written in a prior session are not automatically
   re-derived on session start.
2. If still FAIL after re-derive, read the gate's `action_required` field —
   it lists how many more approvals are needed and which reviewers are eligible.
3. Have an eligible reviewer add the missing `## Review of <area>` section to
   their `pipeline/code-review/by-<role>.md`, then run `devteam derive-approvals`
   and `devteam merge peer-review`.

### Review file format

Reviewers write per-area sections inside their review file, each
ending with a `REVIEW: APPROVED` or `REVIEW: CHANGES REQUESTED` marker
on its own line:

```markdown
# Review by <reviewer-name>

## Review of backend
<comments, BLOCKER/SUGGESTION/QUESTION entries>

REVIEW: APPROVED

## Review of platform
<comments>

REVIEW: CHANGES REQUESTED
BLOCKER: <text>
```

The `approval-derivation.js` hook (PostToolUse on Write/Edit) parses these
sections and updates `pipeline/gates/stage-05.<area>.json` accordingly.
**Do not author `approvals` or `changes_requested` fields directly** — the
hook is the single writer; direct edits are overwritten on the next file save.

Every `BLOCKER: <text>` line in a `CHANGES REQUESTED` section is automatically
extracted by the hook into the gate's `blockers[]` array so stage managers can
read blocker text without grepping review files. The `blockers` array is reset
on each hook run for that area, so a re-review that flips to `APPROVED` clears it.

For the full hook contract (how approval-derivation.js parses sections,
`blockers[]` JSON schema, and `affected_workstreams` derivation on the merged
gate) see `docs/conventions.md §Stage 5 approval-derivation hook contract`.

### READ-ONLY Reviewer Rule (strictly enforced)

During a Stage 5 review invocation, a reviewer agent writes ONLY to:
  - `pipeline/code-review/by-{reviewer}.md` (their review file)
  - `pipeline/gates/stage-05.{area}.json` (approval gate — hook-managed fields only)

A reviewer agent MUST NOT:
  - Use `Write` or `Edit` on any file under `src/`
  - Amend or refactor the author's code, even for a one-line "obvious fix"
  - Add themselves to `approvals` in a stage-05 gate if they modified any
    source file during the same invocation — the gate is then invalid

If the reviewer finds a bug, missing guard, or other BLOCKER: they write
`REVIEW: CHANGES REQUESTED` in their review file, list the blocker, and
halt. The orchestrator re-invokes the owning dev agent to fix it in their
own worktree. **No fix-forward. No exceptions for "small" patches.**

Rationale: silent inline fixes bypass the owning dev, skip re-review of
the patched lines, and leave no audit trail tying the patch to a
CHANGES-REQUESTED → addressed loop. If the one-line patch has a second
bug, no reviewer is assigned to catch it.

### Gate merge (hook-derived)

Each area gate accumulates approvals via `approval-derivation.js`. The gate
reaches `"status": "PASS"` when `approvals.length >= required_approvals` AND
`changes_requested` is empty. Do not manually edit the `approvals` array —
the hook reconciles the gate on every reviewer file save and overwrites any
direct edit.

Pre-read requirement (pass to each reviewer agent):
  - `pipeline/brief.md`
  - `pipeline/design-spec.md`
  - `pipeline/adr/` (all files)
  - The other reviewer's file if already written (sequential fallback)

On architectural escalation: invoke `principal` agent. Principal ruling is binding.
On deadlock (reviewers disagree, no escalation): invoke `principal` agent to decide.

### Review round limit

To prevent an unbounded review-fix spiral, the orchestrator enforces a
**two-round maximum** per area per pipeline run:

- **Round 1**: reviewer writes `CHANGES REQUESTED` → owning dev fixes →
  reviewer re-reviews.
- **Round 2**: if the same reviewer writes `CHANGES REQUESTED` again on
  the same area, the orchestrator **must not** invoke the dev a third time.
  Instead it invokes the `principal` agent with:
  - The two review files
  - The dev's PR file
  - The brief and design spec
  The Principal makes a binding ruling: either the blocker is resolved
  (dev implements Principal's ruling and the reviewer approves), or the
  pipeline FAILs with an explicit rejection.

The round counter resets if a different reviewer takes over the area.
Record the escalation in `pipeline/context.md` as
`REVIEW-ESCALATED: <area> after 2 rounds — principal ruling requested`.


## Gate

Workstream gate files: `pipeline/gates/stage-05.<area>.json` (one per area).
Merged stage gate: `pipeline/gates/stage-05.json`.

```json
{
  "stage": "stage-05",
  "status": "PASS | FAIL",
  "track": "full",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "orchestrator": "devteam@<version>",
  "workstream": "backend | frontend | platform | qa",
  "host": "claude-code",
  "blockers": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "area": "backend | frontend | platform | qa",
  "review_shape": "scoped | matrix",
  "required_approvals": 2,
  "approvals": ["dev-frontend", "security-engineer"],
  "changes_requested": [
    { "reviewer": "dev-backend", "timestamp": "<ISO>" }
  ],
  "escalated_to_principal": false
}
```

`approvals` and `changes_requested` are written by the `approval-derivation.js` hook,
not by the reviewer agent. `status: "PASS"` when `approvals.length >= required_approvals`
AND `changes_requested` is empty.
