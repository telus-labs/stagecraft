# Stage 2 — Design (Principal)

Invoke: `principal` agent.
Input: `pipeline/brief.md`, org-shared ADR memory.
Output: `pipeline/design-spec.md`, `pipeline/adr/`.

Consult org-shared ADRs from prior projects before drafting. Honor or explicitly
supersede prior commitments. The gate records which ADRs were consulted and
superseded so future audits can verify the architecture didn't silently drift (G8).

See `templates/design-spec-template.md` for the canonical blank form;
`docs/design-spec-template.md` is the annotation guide.

## Gate

Gate file: `pipeline/gates/stage-02.json`.

```json
{
  "stage": "stage-02",
  "status": "PASS",
  "track": "full",
  "timestamp": "<ISO 8601>",
  "orchestrator": "devteam@<version>",
  "blockers": [],
  "warnings": [],
  "arch_approved": true,
  "pm_approved": true,
  "adr_count": 2,
  "adrs_consulted": ["ADR-007", "ADR-012"],
  "adrs_superseded": []
}
```

`arch_approved` and `pm_approved` must both be `true` before build begins.
`adr_count` is the number of ADRs written or updated in this stage.
`adrs_consulted` lists prior ADR IDs reviewed; `adrs_superseded` lists any
that this design explicitly overrides.
